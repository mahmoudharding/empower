    "## What is a Jupyter Notebook?\n",
    "\n",
    "A Jupyter Notebook is an interactive coding environment that allows you to write and run code, display visualizations, and document your work with text, equations, and images, all in the same place. It's especially popular in data science because of its ability to combine code execution and explanation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Edit Mode vs. Command Mode \n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebook has a modal user interface. This means that the keyboard does different things depending on which mode the Notebook is in. There are two modes: **\"Edit mode\"** and **\"Command mode\"**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Edit mode allows you to type and modify the content within a cell, similar to a text editor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Command mode lets you manage the notebook as a whole (e.g., adding, deleting, or moving cells), but it doesn't allow you to type directly into individual cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Kernel\n",
    "\n",
    "The **kernel** is the program that runs the code inside your notebook and displays the results. In the top-right corner of your window, you'll see the name `[Python 3 (ipykernel)]` and a circle that indicates the status of your kernel. An empty circle (⚪) means the kernel is idle and ready to execute code, while a filled circle (⚫) means the kernel is busy running code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cells\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebooks are made up of cells. As covered in lecture, there are two types of cells in a Jupyter Notebook: code cells and Markdown cells. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Code cells are where we write all of our Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Markdown cells allow us to write text, like the text you're reading right now. In Homework 1, you'll get a chance to learn a bit of basic Markdown.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Code cells\n",
    "\n",
    "Running a code cell executes all the code within it, and any output will appear directly below the cell. Notice the brackets `[ ]:` on the left side of the cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before running the cell, this will be empty (`[ ]`). While the cell is running, you'll see `[*]`, indicating that the code is still processing. If the asterisk (`*`) remains for too long, it may mean the code is taking longer than expected, and you might need to interrupt the kernel (explained below). Once the cell has finished running, a number will appear inside the brackets, such as `[1]`, representing the order in which cells have been executed. The first cell you run will display a `1`, the second will display a `2`, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your kernel becomes unresponsive, your notebook slows down significantly, or the kernel disconnects, you can try the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. At the top of your screen, click **Kernel**, then **Interrupt Kernel**. Trying running your code again.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If that doesn't help, click **Kernel**, then **Restart Kernel**. If you do this, you will have to run your code cells from the start of your notebook up until where you paused your work.\n",
    "\n",
    "After you run a cell, the brackets will be populated with a number, indicating how many times you've executed code cells in this session, including the current one.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the code in a code cell, first click on that cell to activate it.  It'll be highlighted with a little green or blue rectangle.  Next, hold down the `shift` key and press `return` or `enter`. You could also click the \"Run cell\" button ( ▶| ) in the cell toolbar above.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** After you make changes to the text cell don't forget to click the \"Run cell\" button at the top that looks like ▶| or hold down `shift` + `return` to view the changes."

    "#### Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever you write code, you'll make mistakes.  When you run a code cell that has errors, Python will sometimes produce error messages to tell you what you did wrong. Errors are okay; even experienced programmers make many errors.  When you make an error, you just have to find the source of the problem, fix it, and move on.\n",

    "1. The caret (`^`) is pointing to the end of the line, indicating the exact spot where Python expects additional input, in this case, a closing parenthesis `)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A `SyntaxError` means there is something wrong with the structure of your code, and Python cannot understand or execute it as written. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The message \"incomplete input\" is telling you that Python reached the end of the code (or the end of the line) but didn't find what it expected to complete the `print()` function call. Here, the missing piece is the closing parenthesis `)`.\n",
